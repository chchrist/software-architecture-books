    # Awesome Software Architecture Books

A curated list of books on, or relevant to, Software Architecture.

People in the software industry have long argued about a definition of architecture. Ralph Johnson famously defined
software architecture as "the important stuff (whatever that is)." I, subjectively, followed his definition while
deciding whether or not to include a specific book.

## How did I make this?

I thoroughly reviewed all books
[tagged with software-architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/software-architecture) on Goodreads and picked
the best objectivelyâ€”see the selection criteria below. I don't think, by any means, this list is comprehensive. Yet, I'm
planning to update it regularly to make it as comprehensive as possible.

## Inclusion criteria

- The book must be relevant to Software Architecture; and
- The content is not obsolete.
- It must be technology agnostic or applicable to a wide range of technologies; and
- The book profile on Goodreads matches these rules:
    - An average rating of 3.5 or above; and
    - A total number of ratings equals 50 or above.
    - At least 5 written reviews.
    - A minimum length of 50 pages.

## Sorting criteria

The books are sorted solely based on the number of written reviews. There are, however, other important factors worth
considering. For example, the average rating, the number of ratings, and the publishing date. Yet, I don't have an idea
to put all these factors in a reasonable mathematical formula. If you have
any, [I'd love to hear](https://github.com/mhadidg/software-architecture-books/issues/new) what you've got in mind.
